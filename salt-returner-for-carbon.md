# Using salt to feed the graphite carbon daemon

*Part #2 in the VM visualisations series using salt. Read [Part #1](/vm-monitoring-using-salt-and-cubism)

I deemed my experiment in Part #1 a success, but it had a huge drawback in not keeping any state, it was only refreshing fresh data all the time. It also would not scale for multi user, because the fetching would be too heavy for many users to be monitoring simultaneously. Thus I had a new goal, separate the metric retrieving from the metric displaying. The plan is to collect metrics using [Salt](http://saltstack.org) and its [Returner](http://docs.saltstack.org/en/latest/ref/returners/index.html) component. Returners makes the salt published commands return data using a different route than back to the publisher (master). But first I had to choose a backend.

[Cubism](http://square.github.com/cubism/) the web frontend I am using comes with support for two metric storing backends:

* [graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) 
* [Cube](https://github.com/square/cube/wiki)

Cube has a mongodb + node stack. Graphite is built using python components whisper, carbon, and graphite-web. [Whisper](http://graphite.wikidot.com/whisper) is a RRD-alike format, [Carbon](http://graphite.wikidot.com/carbon) is a network daemon and collector backend for whisper, and graphite-web is written in django. Since I'm a fan of both python and django I decided to go with the graphite stack.

A simple diagram of the flow of this setup:

## Graphite server

I wrote a simple graphite state to install the graphite server. Two parts is not covered in the state, the configuration files and service starting. I used all defaults everywhere.

> /srv/salt/base/graphite/init.sls

    graphite:
      pkg.installed:
        - pkgs:
          - python-django
          - python-pip
          - python-django-tagging
          - python-dev
          - python-twisted
          - python-memcache
          - memcached
          - python-cairo

    graphite-web:
      pip.installed:
          - require:
            - pkg: graphite

    whisper:
      pip.installed:
          - require:
            - pkg: graphite

    carbon:
      pip.installed:
          - require:
            - pkg: graphite


## The carbon returner

Carbon supports two protocols and pickle, I struggled abit with getting pickle to work, so for testing I am using the text line protocol. That also enabled me to debug easier. I'm also happy to say that my carbon returner got merged into saltstack upstream, so it can be used and improved by everyone that's interested.

    '''
    Take data from salt and "return" it into a carbon receiver

    Add the following configuration to your minion configuration files::

        carbon.host: <server ip address>

    '''

    import pickle
    import socket

    import struct

    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

    def __virtual__():
        return 'carbon'

    def _formatHostname(hostname, separator='_'):
        ''' carbon uses . as separator, so replace this in the hostname '''
        return hostname.replace('.', separator)

    def returner(ret):
        '''

        log.debug('Carbon minion configured with host: {0}:{1}'.format(host, port))
        if not host or not port:
            log.error('Host or port not defined')
            return

        try:
            carbon_sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM, socket.IPPROTO_TCP)
            carbon_sock.connect((host, port))
        except socket.error as e:
            log.error('Error connecting to {0}:{1}, {2}'.format(host, port, e))
            return

        timestamp = int(time.time())

        saltdata = ret['return']
        metric_base = ret['fun']
        metrics = []
        for name, vals in saltdata.items():
            for key, val in vals.items():
                # XXX: force datatype, needs typechecks, etc
                val = int(val)

        def send_textmetrics(metrics):
            ''' Use text protorocol to send metric over socket '''
            data = []
            for metric in metrics:
                metric = '{0} {1} {2}'.format(metric[0], metric[1], metric[2])
                data.append(metric)
            data = '\n'.join(data)
            total_sent_bytes = 0
            while total_sent_bytes < len(data):
                sent_bytes = carbon_sock.send(data[total_sent_bytes:])
                if sent_bytes == 0: 
                    log.error('Bytes sent 0, Connection reset?')
                    return
                logging.debug("Sent %d bytes to carbon" % sent_bytes)
                total_sent_bytes += sent_bytes

        # Send metrics
        send_textmetrics(metrics)

        # Shut down and close socket
        carbon_sock.shutdown(socket.SHUT_RDWR)
        carbon_sock.close()


# Metric pushing

The carbon returner has a weak point in its design, it only supports one type of data, dicts within dicts, since that was all I had to support to get my virt module metrics into carbon. One thing it could be easily extended to do is parse output from all the existing munin plugins, or collected plugins. But lets not get ahead of ourselves, lets see if the runner works.

I decided on a simple 10 second timer for pushing data, that seemed granular enough for my purposes. So I just ran a simple zsh loop that runs the salt command virt.vm_cputime on my KVM nodegroup, and specify that I want to return the data to the carbon returner.

    while true; do sleep 10; salt -N 'kvm' virt.vm_cputime --return carbon; done

**et voilÃ !** metrics are now persisted by the graphite stack. And I can now return to my client and rewrite cubism client to use graphite backend.

# The JavaScript

The graphite queries include wildcard support, so I could easily get graphs for rx_bytes, tx_bytes, disk_counters and cputime using one simple function. If I want multicolored graphs per host I would have to make some changes.

    var graphite_cubism = function(metric_name, metric_vals) {
        var seconds = 10;

        // Create cubism context
        context = cubism.context()
            .serverDelay(seconds * 1000) // allow 10 seconds of collection lag
            .step(seconds * 1000)         // 10 seconds per value
            .size(700);          // fetch 1080 values (pixels)
        graphite = context.graphite('/graphite/');
        // Search graphite for CPU metrics
        graphite.find('virt.'+metric_name+'.*.'+metric_vals, function(error, results) {

            var metrics = []; // list of metrics

            $.each(results, function(idx, metric) {
                var alias = metric.split('.')[2] + ' ' + metric.split('.').slice(-1);
                metrics.push(graphite.metric("sumSeries(nonNegativeDerivative("+metric+"))").
            });

            // Create the graphs and add to #graphs container
            d3.select("#graphs").call( function(div) {

              // An axis at the top
              div.append("div")
                  .attr("class", "axis")
                  .call(context.axis().orient("top"));

              // All the horizon graphs
              div.selectAll(".horizon")
                  .data(metrics)
                  .enter().append("div")
                  .attr("class", "horizon")
                  .call(context.horizon());

              div.append("div")
                  .attr("class", "rule")
                  .call(context.rule());

            });
    });
